Basically a demonstration of node and react.
By now, i'll let the main branch with the older version of the folder, wich contains only de admin app, and the second branch with the newest version of the folder, wich contains the client website.
Why? because i'm working especially with the client version, and dont have time to test if the changes i did in the folders broke the project. By Monday i'll try to test everything and transfer everything to the main branch.

Admin:
just a basic crud with node-express, using handlebars to render it all.

client:
A more complex website, running on vite, wich i'm trying at my best to make it fancy, fixable and reuzable.
